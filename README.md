## Jet Project

### Week 3 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

 Program initially reads a text file and stores the information into an list of jets.

 User is presented with a menu of options. The user can list all the jets currently in the fleet. User can also run a variety of commands to display messages when all the jets fly, see the fastest jet, see the jet with the longest range, load all the cargo jets, or initiate a dog fight between 2 combat ready jets.

 User is also able to add a jet to the fleet as either a cargo carrier or a combat ready. If added as a combat ready, that jet can participate in a dogfight. User will have to enter additional information such as the model, speed, range, and price of the jet.

 User is also able to remove jets from the fleet. They will be given a list of jets with a corresponding index number. User selects the index number of the desired jet to remove.

 User is also able to quit the program from the menu prompt.

### Lessons Learned

A list is able to provide the index of items stored in the list, whereas a collection is unable to. When forming the remove jet from fleet method, I initially had the jets stored in a collection and that resulted in a difficult time in allowing the user the capability to remove jets. Overall containing the jets in a list worked out much better for the purpose and requirements of this program.

Using instanceof proved especially helpful when filtering between methods that should only apply to cargo carriers vs combat ready.

Communication with classmates and having an open mind to other methods and approaches to the problems has taught me quite a bit. Slight differences in approaches has enlightened me to new ways of thinking that I can further apply down the road.
